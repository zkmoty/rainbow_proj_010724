    <p>You could never know what it&#39;s like
        <br/>Your blood like winter, freezes just like ice
        <br/>And there&#39;s a cold, lonely light that shines from you
        <br/>You&#39;ll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
    </p>
    <p>And did you think this fool could never win?
        <br/>Well, look at me, I&#39;m coming back again
        <br/>I got a taste of love in a simple way
        <br/>And if you need to know, while I&#39;m still standing, you just fade away
    </p>
    <p>Don&#39;t you know I&#39;m still standing better than I ever did?
        <br/>Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing after all this time
        <br/>Picking up the pieces of my life, without you on my mind
    </p>
    <p>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
    </p>
    <p>Once, I never coulda hoped to win
        <br/>You starting down the road, leaving me again
        <br/>The threats you made were meant to cut me down
        <br/>And if our love was just a circus, you&#39;d be a clown by now
    </p>
    <p>You know I&#39;m still standing better than I ever did
        <br/>Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing after all this time
        <br/>Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
    </p>
    <p>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
    </p>
    <p>Don&#39;t you know that I&#39;m still standing better than I ever did?
        <br/>Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing after all this time
        <br/>Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
    </p>
    <p>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
        <br/>I&#39;m still standing, yeah, yeah, y
